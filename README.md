# Game Name Here :)
<!--- # Ghostlight
Ghostlight is a game! I have huge ideas for this game, but I'm not sure how to execute them. So for now, we can't say anything for certain. It hopefully will be a horror game, but it may just be an RPG. Only time will tell. -->

## Class Diagram
This is just a rough draft - will be updated/fixed later as the game progresses.
## GUI

## Download Directions
### Mac
1. Make sure that **python3** is **installed** on your computer; some computers already have it lurking in the deep depths of your computer and you may not need to summon it. You can find the download link here: **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. **Download** the ~~virus~~ game! Open Finder and **uncompress the game** to release it into the world. Right click on the folder, and select **"New Terminal at Folder"**. (second to last option)
3. Make sure **Pygame** is **installed** by speaking the incantation **"pip3 install pygame"** into the terminal. It'll take a few seconds to download- don't worry, waiting a few seconds won't kill you, just a blink of time that amounts to nothing in infinity's face.
4. Awaken the game from it's slumber by typing, **"python3 main.py"**. Voila, the game should start running!
