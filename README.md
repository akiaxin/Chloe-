# Game Name Here :)
<!--- # Ghostlight
Ghostlight is a game! I have huge ideas for this game, but I'm not sure how to execute them. So for now, we can't say anything for certain. It hopefully will be a horror game, but it may just be an RPG. Only time will tell. -->

## Class Diagram
This is just a rough draft - will be updated/fixed later as the game progresses.
## GUI

## Download Directions
### Mac
1. Make sure that python3 is installed on your computer; some computers have it pre-installed. You can find the download link here: https://www.python.org/downloads/
2. Download the game! Open Finder and uncompress the game, right click on the folder, and click "New Terminal at Folder". (second to last option)
3. Make sure Pygame is installed by typing "pip3 install pygame" into the terminal. It'll take a few seconds to download- don't worry, waiting a few seconds won't kill you.
4. Run the game by typing, "python3 main.py". The game should start running!
