# Ghostlight
A graphical reverse horror game that flips the script on ghostly encounters. Play as a ghostly spirit protecting your haunted estate, which is constantly assaulted by curious vloggers, television crews, and intrepid ghost hunters due to rumours of the estate being haunted. As the ghostly guardian, you're tasked with guarding the estate.

## Download Directions
### Mac
1. Make sure that **python3** is **installed** on your computer; some computers already have it lurking in the deep depths of your computer and you may not need to summon it. You can find the download link here: **https://www.python.org/downloads/**
2. **Download** the ~~virus~~ game! Open Finder and **uncompress the game** to release it into the world. Right click on the folder, and select **"New Terminal at Folder"**. (second to last option)
3. Make sure **Pygame** is **installed** by speaking the incantation **"pip3 install pygame"** into the terminal. It'll take a few seconds to download- don't worry, waiting a few seconds won't kill you, just a blink of time that amounts to nothing in infinity's face.
4. Awaken the game from it's slumber by typing, **"python3 main.py"**. Voila, the game should start running!
