# Game Name Here :)
<!--- # Ghostlight
Ghostlight is a game! I have huge ideas for this game, but I'm not sure how to execute them. So for now, we can't say anything for certain. It hopefully will be a horror game, but it may just be an RPG. Only time will tell. -->

## Class Diagram
This is just a rough draft - will be updated/fixed later as the game progresses.
